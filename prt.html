      <div id="about"></div>
My name is Gigi Rubio. I'm 23 years old, born 1996. My ambitions are becoming successful, happy, being able to provide for my family and repay everyone who's ever been good to me and anyone else who needs help. I plan on doing that by beginning a career in Coding. I am a down-to-earth very hard-working, determined team player. I love helping people just as much as I love learning. I am also very adaptable, patient, and innovative. I am a Front-End Web Developer specializing in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I enjoy JS and HTML the most. I love anything that expands the mind to broader horizons, connects one thing to another, and is based off conceptualization.

My hobbies include all art fields but especially Photography and Language Arts as well as most forms of Programming such as Music, Film, Photo Editing. I also thoroughly enjoy the study of Philosophy, Statistics, and  Entrepreneurship/Investing.

<p>My professional goals are excelling at Coding so that I may be able to work a good, full time job in this. In time, I hope to be able to work on my own with my own team with ideas and eventually become a professional app developer.</p></div>
